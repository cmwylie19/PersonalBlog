The scientific method is one of trial and error. The repititve process
of collecting feedback and make incremental improvements is one that is rampant
in the sciences. This is the industry accepted way to create new applications
when working with someone less savvy.

It is a boring and daunting task, of hours upon hours of listening to people argue,
and then after that ends, you are expected to be in alignment once again and work
cohesively to implement the prototype in code, which brings me to the basis of this
artifact: in software, it is my theory that much more cohesive, aligned, and focused apps
can be built by incorporting the use of small, highly talented teams.

I will be pointing out the parts of the design sprint that I think have the largest amount of room
for improvement and why. The key to the success of this methodology is focus over
durations of time.
