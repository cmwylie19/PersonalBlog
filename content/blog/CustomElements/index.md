## The Custom Element

_Whether you are writing your own design library or implementing a component to satisfy a design created in a prototyping tool like Sketch or Invision, the custom reuseable component is a powerful tool that every full stack or frontend engineer should have in their tool belt._

### CheckList

_All custom elements have a common set of minimum requirements_
- **Name with a dash* - all custom elements require a name with a dash in it. For example, "custom-list", "italic-paragraph", "bold-paragraph", are all acceptable names.
- **A Class** - which defines the element's behavior.
