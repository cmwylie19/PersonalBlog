## Hedge against change

Change is inevitable, and is often be perceived as a negative and intimidating, but in the tech industry, **change is necessary for growth**. In this rapidly evolving world of technology staying up to date with the latest developments is crucial for success in the field. Embracing change is not just about keeping up with the latest bleeding edge technology, but also about continuously developing and improving one's skills and knowledge.  
  
 [_No matter what you are doing, try to improve by at least 1% each day_]

One way to embrace change is by embracing new challenges and opportunities. When faced with a problem or obstacle, instead of shying away from it, consider it an opportunity for growth. By taking on a new challenge, you are forced to learn and develop new skills and knowledge. This not only helps you become a better engineer (or whatever you are), but it also helps you grow as a person and expand your horizons.

[_New problem areas are opporunities to master new skills and make yourself more marketable/valuable._]

Another way to embrace change is to continuously educate yourself and seek out new experiences. This could involve attending workshops, conferences, or taking online courses. By learning new technologies, methodologies, and best practices, you are able to stay up-to-date and relevant in your field. Additionally, attending events and networking with other engineers can provide you with new perspectives and ideas that can inspire you to try new approaches and think outside the box.

[_Stay hungry, you are never too good to learn more, just **enjoy the process**, learn, practice, and repeat by learning something new._]

Finally, embrace change by being open-minded and flexible. As an engineer, it's important to have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, but being able to adapt and evolve with the times is just as important. Being open to new ideas and approaches can help you stay ahead of the curve and be a more innovative and valuable contributor to your team and organization.

[_Being a person first before an engineer. How you work with others and how they view you have a direct impact on how you are seen professionally and the opportunities you are given._]

In conclusion, embracing change is essential for growth as an engineer. By embracing new challenges, continuously educating yourself, and being open-minded and flexible, you can stay up-to-date and relevant in your field and continuously improve your skills and knowledge. Embrace change, and watch yourself grow and succeed as an engineer. When one door closes, one door opens...

# Key Take Aways
 - Reframe the way you look at problems; consider them as opportunities. This gives you the ability to look things from a different perspective. How can you turn your problem into an opportunity for growth?
 - Control what you can, forwhat you can't control; make the decision not to stress about it. Put in the work and the hours, but after work, leave the stress behind and give yourself permission to rest/recharge.
