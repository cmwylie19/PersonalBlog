Why I'm blogging right now.

After spending the second night of being away for almost all night, despite being extremely fatigued
I decided to something different other than 'sitting in the chair', which is what my wife refers to as
my method of working. Happily so too, with quarantine and uncertain times in the world one must strive
to improve oneselfs perhaps in non conventional methods.

The real reason for the blog was primarily motivated by money. Strangely enough having built hundreds or thousands of
applications I catch myself wondering what would be like to experience the process from another side.

Bring on the gains, 💪🏻.
